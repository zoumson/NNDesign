<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The primary intention of writing this project is to give an overview of how one can have an insight on neural netwrok. 

In this project a basic human brain unit is created, namely, percepton. 

* To solve a very simple question, as human, my son don't need to think that much, only one percepton in his brain can be used. 
* As caring father, I can decide to give him all the tools needed to solve the problem. 
* As a careless father, I can decide to let him learn the problem by himself. 
* As the problem become complex, and my son grows up, he can use multiple perceptron to solve the problems.
